# HTMTL

HTMTL (HyperText Markup _Templating_ Language) is a templating language that uses HTML attributes for its rendering logic. 
It is both a subset and superset of HTML, meaning that valid HTML is also valid HTMTL and valid HTMTL is also valid HTML, allowing 
you to use any editor without needing any additional plugins.
